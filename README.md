# QuantumMonteCarlo

The Diffusion Monte Carlo method is one variant of Quantum Monte Carlo (Reynolds, Peter J.; Tobochnik, Jan; Gould, Harvey (1990). "Diffusion Quantum Monte Carlo". Computers in Physics. 4 (6): 662–668. Bibcode:1990ComPh...4..662R. doi:10.1063/1.4822960) whose goal is to find numerically the ground state of many-body quantum systems. The main theoretical steps for the development of this method are given in the PDF. <br>
The algorithm is developed in FORTRAN, and the energy and wave function of the ground state obtained for different quantum systems will be compared with exact, experimental or other numerical solutions.<br>
Such benchmark few-body systems used in this work are: 1D Harmonic Oscillator, Morse Oscillator, Hydrogen Atom, H– , H2+, H3+ ions and H2 molecule.
